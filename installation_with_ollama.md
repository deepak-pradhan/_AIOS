Title: Personalization, Cognition, and Gamification-based Programming Language Learning: A State-of-the-Art Systematic Literature Review
Authors: Kashif Ishaq, Atif Alvi
Summary: Programming courses in computing science are important because they are often
the first introduction to computer programming for many students. Many
university students are overwhelmed with the information they must learn for an
introductory course. The current teacher-lecturer model of learning commonly
employed in university lecture halls often results in a lack of motivation and
participation in learning. Personalized gamification is a pedagogical approach
that combines gamification and personalized learning to motivate and engage
students while addressing individual differences in learning. This approach
integrates gamification and personalized learning strategies to inspire and
involve students while addressing their unique learning needs and differences.
A comprehensive literature search was conducted by including 81 studies that
were analyzed based on their research design, intervention, outcome measures,
and quality assessment. The findings suggest that personalized gamification can
enhance student cognition in programming courses by improving motivation,
engagement, and learning outcomes. However, the effectiveness of personalized
gamification varies depending on various factors, such as the type of
gamification elements used, the degree of personalization, and the
characteristics of the learners. This paper provides insights into designing
and implementing effective personalized gamification interventions in
programming courses. The findings could inform educational practitioners and
researchers in programming education about the potential benefits of
personalized gamification and its implications for educational practice.

Title: Co-Creation of Innovative Gamification Based Learning: A Case of Synchronous Partnership
Authors: Nicholas Dacre, Vasilis Gkogkidis, Peter Jenkins
Summary: In higher education, gamification offers the prospect of providing a pivotal
shift from traditional asynchronous forms of engagement, to developing methods
to foster greater levels of synchronous interactivity and partnership between
and amongst teaching and learning stakeholders. The small vein of research that
focuses on gamification in teaching and learning contexts, has mainly focused
on the implementation of pre-determined game elements. This approach reflects a
largely asynchronous approach to the development of learning practices in
educational settings, thereby limiting stakeholder engagement in their design
and adoption. Therefore, we draw on the theory of co-creation to examine the
development process of gamification-based learning as a synchronous partnership
between and amongst teaching and learning stakeholders. Empirical insights
suggest that students gain a greater sense of partnership and inclusivity as
part of a synchronous co-creation gamification-based learning development and
implementation process.

Title: Computers in Secondary Schools: Educational Games
Authors: Margarida Romero
Summary: This entry introduces educational games in secondary schools. Educational
games include three main types of educational activities with a playful
learning intention supported by digital technologies: educational serious
games, educational gamification, and learning through game creation.
Educational serious games are digital games that support learning objectives.
Gamification is defined as the use of "game design elements and game thinking
in a non-gaming context" (Deterding et al. 2011, p. 13). Educational
gamification is not developed through a digital game but includes game elements
for supporting the learning objectives. Learning through game creation is
focused on the process of designing and creating a prototype of a game to
support a learning process related to the game creation proc

Title: Quantifying Mental Health from Social Media with Neural User Embeddings
Authors: Silvio Amir, Glen Coppersmith, Paula Carvalho, M√°rio J. Silva, Byron C. Wallace
Summary: Mental illnesses adversely affect a significant proportion of the population
worldwide. However, the methods traditionally used for estimating and
characterizing the prevalence of mental health conditions are time-consuming
and expensive. Consequently, best-available estimates concerning the prevalence
of mental health conditions are often years out of date. Automated approaches
to supplement these survey methods with broad, aggregated information derived
from social media content provides a potential means for near real-time
estimates at scale. These may, in turn, provide grist for supporting,
evaluating and iteratively improving upon public health programs and
interventions.
  We propose a novel model for automated mental health status quantification
that incorporates user embeddings. This builds upon recent work exploring
representation learning methods that induce embeddings by leveraging social
media post histories. Such embeddings capture latent characteristics of
individuals (e.g., political leanings) and encode a soft notion of homophily.
In this paper, we investigate whether user embeddings learned from twitter post
histories encode information that correlates with mental health statuses. To
this end, we estimated user embeddings for a set of users known to be affected
by depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and for a set of
demographically matched `control' users. We then evaluated these embeddings
with respect to: (i) their ability to capture homophilic relations with respect
to mental health status; and (ii) the performance of downstream mental health
prediction models based on these features. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the user embeddings capture similarities between users with respect to
mental conditions, and are predictive of mental health.

Title: Representation Bias of Adolescents in AI: A Bilingual, Bicultural Study
Authors: Robert Wolfe, Aayushi Dangol, Bill Howe, Alexis Hiniker
Summary: Popular and news media often portray teenagers with sensationalism, as both a
risk to society and at risk from society. As AI begins to absorb some of the
epistemic functions of traditional media, we study how teenagers in two
countries speaking two languages: 1) are depicted by AI, and 2) how they would
prefer to be depicted. Specifically, we study the biases about teenagers
learned by static word embeddings (SWEs) and generative language models (GLMs),
comparing these with the perspectives of adolescents living in the U.S. and
Nepal. We find English-language SWEs associate teenagers with societal
problems, and more than 50% of the 1,000 words most associated with teenagers
in the pretrained GloVe SWE reflect such problems. Given prompts about
teenagers, 30% of outputs from GPT2-XL and 29% from LLaMA-2-7B GLMs discuss
societal problems, most commonly violence, but also drug use, mental illness,
and sexual taboo. Nepali models, while not free of such associations, are less
dominated by social problems. Data from workshops with N=13 U.S. adolescents
and N=18 Nepalese adolescents show that AI presentations are disconnected from
teenage life, which revolves around activities like school and friendship.
Participant ratings of how well 20 trait words describe teens are decorrelated
from SWE associations, with Pearson's r=.02, n.s. in English FastText and
r=.06, n.s. in GloVe; and r=.06, n.s. in Nepali FastText and r=-.23, n.s. in
GloVe. U.S. participants suggested AI could fairly present teens by
highlighting diversity, while Nepalese participants centered positivity.
Participants were optimistic that, if it learned from adolescents, rather than
media sources, AI could help mitigate stereotypes. Our work offers an
understanding of the ways SWEs and GLMs misrepresent a developmenta
